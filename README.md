Small personality quizz application POC.
It takes the answers given to a set of questions and does a simple calculation of results, mapping the user to either an **Introvert** or **Extrovert** profile.

**Note:** The questions and answers were taken from an *actual* personality quiz website, but our algorithm does not match what is used by them. 
The results are not strict and follow a very simple matching algorithm.
